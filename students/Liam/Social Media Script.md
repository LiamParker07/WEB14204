### Script ###

**Facebook and Twitter are sat talking while Instagram walks in**

**Instagram** Hey Facebook look at me, look at me!

**Facebook** What do you want Instagram?

**Instagram** Twitter, look at me Twitter!

**Twitter sighs and turns back to Facebook**

**Twitter** Not Instagram again, look at that #attentionseeker.

**Instagram runs over to Facebook and Twitter**

**Instagram** Come on guys, look at me, I'm the best!

**Facebook** Go away Instagram, all you are is a bunch of pictures. Not only can I post pictures, I can write as much as I want. 

**Twitter** Yeh Instagram, come back when you have 140 characters like me.

**Instragram runs off to another group of people**
