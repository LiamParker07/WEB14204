# Interviewing Humans #

**Have you put any of the advice in the article into practice already? What worked? What could have been better?**

The article was incredibly useful and allowed me to highlight key interview skills that I've put into practise already, as well as advice I can take into future interviews. The beginning of the article talks about preparation and advises going into interviews with an interview guide, something you can use as a reference to keep interviews on topic and get everything you need out of interviews. This is advice that I already put into practise during both the face2face interviews and user-testing enabling me to get all the answers I needed.

In terms of things that could have been better, after reading the article I need to make sure that all of the questions I ask during interviews are open questions. I occasionally find myself asking closed questions that can only be answered with "Yes" or "No" when I want a definitive answer about a particular topic. Instead, I should ask these questions in a way that will get the person being interviewed talking by asking about their views on a topic or their feelings towards something. For example, "What are your thoughts on the design of this page?", rather than "Do you like the design of this page?".

**In your experience, what's most challenging about interviewing people?**

In my experience, the most challenging thing about interviewing people is allowing them to think and expand on vague answers. As the article mentions, while silence can be uncomfortable, it's required to allow people to think and give more detailed responses. Getting people to expand on vague answers is also challenging because some people may not want to go into detail or may feel more comfortable giving short answers that aren't particularly helpful. As an interviewer, this would be my job to ask follow up questions to get more out of an interview.

**Anything that surprised you?**

If I'm completely honest, nothing in the article really surprised me. Everything the article advised was useful yet somewhat expected when it comes to interviewing humans.

**What did you do with the data that you collected during the interviews?**

After collecting all the data I needed from my interviews I made sure that I had responses for everything listed in my interview guide. Luckily I had, but if I hadn't I would have looked for a couple more people to interview in an attempt to fill in the gaps. I then compared all the data I collected to look for any correlations or similarities within the responses. Furthermore, because I received some great suggestions for features to include I was able to add these to my own ideas and add them to my plans for my social network.
