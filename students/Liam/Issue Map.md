Following on from my issue map I plan to interview more Xbox One users. By messaging people of my Xbox friends list I should be able to find some potential users that wouldn't mind being interviewed over the Xbox. I want to use these interviews to find out whether these potential users would use my social network, and whether they also share the same opinion as me when it comes to the issues I've stated.

These are the main problems that I hope my social network will solve:

1. No social network currently just for Xbox One - gaming social networks trying to cater for all games.
2. Xbox One automatically records clips but there's no easy way to share them.
3. Xbox One matchmaking and the high cost of the Xbox can make it hard to find games.
