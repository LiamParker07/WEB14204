### What are the disadvantages of presenting Photoshop documents, as opposed to other ways of communicating a design (according to the author)?

According to the article, there are a number of disadvantages to presenting Photoshop documents as a way of communicating a design. The first of these is that while PSD's are useful for designers to show exactly what they want a website to look like, they can't be used to show any sort of animations, interactions or hover/focus states. None of these things can be thought out through a PSD therefore leaving that work to a developer. Fonts also present issues when using PSD's as they render differently in OS and Windows as well as Firefox and Chrome. Fonts will also not look the same when comparing a browser view to a PSD. The author also states that PSD's fall short when it comes to copy as designers can often spend hours designing around the shape and size of copy but in reality, the copy will likely change when it comes to making the site.

### If PSDs are so bad, why do so many people use them as project deliverables?

- They allow designers to present an artist impression of the perfect product to clients.
- Useful for selling a website to the client.

### What alternatives does the author propose to the Photoshop-driven design process?

The author proposes a couple of alternatives to the Photoshop-driven design process. Firstly, the author states that designers should learn to code which would enable designers to create mockups that would look a lot more comparable to the real site than a PSD would. Collaboration is also suggested so that front end developers and designers could work together much more, moving closer to the browser and creating prototypes together.
