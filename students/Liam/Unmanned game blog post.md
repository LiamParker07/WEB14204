# Unmanned Game #

My task over the week was to try out a game called Unmanned and blog about it.

Unmanned is a video game that deals with war, differently to most others I might add. Throughout the game you play as a modern day member of the military playing out a number of different scenarios. These scenarios range from shaving, driving to work and blowing up a suspected insurgent thousands of miles away. What makes this different to most military games is that each of these scenarios depicts a different part of a modern soldiers life.

Unmanned arguably presents a much more realistic vision of a soldiers life by not only allowing you to play out his work life, but also his home life as well. Throughout each of these scenarios your aim is to collect awards by either selecting the correct chat options or playing the mini games well. I've played the game through a number of times but have only managed to accumulate about half of the possible awards because the game doesn't actually tell you what to have to do to achieve an award, you just have to select the right path.
