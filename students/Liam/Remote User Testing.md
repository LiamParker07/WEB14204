#Remote User Testing#

For remote user testing I tested various designs from early wireframes of the layout of my social network as well as copywrite designs. Although not all of my tests were particularly useful, some were extremely helpful and I found it interesting to see the unbiased opinion from people I do not know.

I tried a few different tests but mostly used 5 second tests and preference tests. My most successful 5 second test showed a wireframe of one of the main screen within my social network and I asked 'What do you think this page was about'?

Another successful test was my copywrite test. I wanted to find out whether during the sign up process people would rather see a cleaner looking interface with less of an explanation or more text and in my opinion a slightly worse looking interface. The results were interesting as seen below:

In order to recruit people for these tests I emailed the link out to a couple of friends for their opinion but was more interested in the opinion of strangers online as I knew they would be unbiased. As a result, I completed a lot of other tests in order to rack up enough points to order testers.

Overall the results were interesting. As I mentioned, some tests were more successful than others and I gained an interesting insight to what was working and what wasn't. I was glad to see that most people were able to understand that the page I showed was meant to be a social network in which media can be shared.
