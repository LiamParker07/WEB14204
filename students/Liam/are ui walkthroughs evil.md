# Are UI walkthroughs evil? #

**Are you planning to use a UI walkthrough in your product?**

For my social network I've thought a lot about the possible inclusion of a UI walkthrough because a number of features within my social network may seem a little confusing at first. I could however solve this problem by designing my social network using a familiar layout and icons to represent different features. In saying this, I may however include helpful prompts that could be toggled on or off to help users use my social network.

**What's your experience with UI walkthroughs on other products?**

As I use apps on a regular basis I'm pretty familiar with UI walkthroughs. Many new apps are now using them and it can be useful as a first time user exploring an unfamiliar app. On the other hand, like the article mentioned it can be fairly annoying if I simply want to install an app and use it for myself. I sometime don't want to have to go through a slow and boring walkthrough.

**What could be an innovative way to guide new users through your product?**

While some may find it annoying, I think it would be interesting to turn guiding new users through my product into a game; my social network is gaming related after all. New users could be given a series of instructions and asked for example to navigate to the games feed. Users could then be scored based on how well they follow the guide and users who didn't do so well could be shown the correct way to use the app.
