## What are my learning goals? ##

**What do I want to get out of this unit/project?**



- I want to learn more about the use of wireframing techniques in order to support possible design ideas. This would be extremely useful because it would allow me to find alternative solutions and help me gain a better understanding of the most effective ways to plan out my design ideas. I aim to achieve this goal by researching new effective wireframing techniques and possibly the use of paper-prototyping as well.

- Develop my knowledge of Illustrator. At the moment, while I feel I have a great knowledge of Photoshop, I want to learn how to use Illustrator more effectively while working on web projects. In order to achieve this I will watch Illustrator tutorials on both [YouTube](http://youtube.com) and [Lynda](http://lynda.com). This is a learning goal which I know I will have achieved when I feel just as confident using Illustrator as I do Photoshop.

- My final goal for this project is to further improve my research skills, enabling me to create a more complete user experience for my project. In previous projects I haven't done much research before starting, therefore I feel both primary and secondary research is the key to producing a great product considering I'll be creating my own social network. By the end of the unit, I aim to take the research skills I've learnt in to future projects.

**Why are these goals important to me?**

These goals are important to me because not only can these skills be used to create a great final product within this unit, they can also be used to improve my future projects and help me in my professional life.

The goal to learn more about wireframing techniques is very important to me because although I've used wireframing before for previous projects, I want to find much better ways to plan my designs. I feel learning how to successfully use paper-prototyping as a wireframing method would really help me with future projects and [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/) is another wireframing method that I have always wanted to try out as well.

Developing my knowledge of Illustrator is another goal that's important to me because I love the design aspect of this course. Although I'm very experienced with Photoshop, I feel that learning how to use Illustrator properly would benefit me a lot in this unit and future projects where vector graphics would be useful for web design.

Lastly, honing my research skills is also important to me because proper research will enable me to the make the very best social network that I can for this unit. Research will also benefit me in future projects and my professional life after university because it's one of those skills that will probably be used for years to come and learning how to do it successfully now is important.
