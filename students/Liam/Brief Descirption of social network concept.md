# ****Brief Description of my Social Network Concept**** #

My social network concept is based around the Xbox One. Although the console is only a couple of years old, there's a large amount of Xbox One gamers, but no social network designed specifically with these people in mind. 

The main idea for my social network is to allow like minded gamers to discuss games they're  currently playing, find new friends to play with and share media such as videos or links to livestreams. I am also looking into including a challenge or leaderboard feature.

I feel this social network is unique because I feel I've chosen a real niche. Furthermore, although there's already a couple of gaming social networks out there, all of those are trying to cater for all gamers, rather than a specific group which I feel I can do effectively with features I propose for my social network.

As for the design process, I've created wireframes for most of the main pages of my social network and have also listed most of the main features I want to include. I now need to decide on some final designs and think about creating all the less important pages.
