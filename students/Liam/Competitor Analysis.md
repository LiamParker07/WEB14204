### Audience(s)

### Relationship(s)

Xblgamerhub and Raptr is to allows users to find fellow gamers who share the same interest in games etc. Rapt does this a lot better than Xblgamerhub who doesn't do it quite as well. Users can form quite personal relationships as they can chat, share reviews and possibly use either of these  to find game sessions and play with people they meet. YouTube however is slightly different. Users generally have a relationship with a person making the videos and in the comments section of these videos.

Within Raptr and Xblgamerhub, users have to reciprocate the relationships they establish, a lot like Facebook. This means that if a user adds another, the other user has to accept a friend request in order for both users to become friends and chat. YouTube again is different in which users can subscribe to channels.
